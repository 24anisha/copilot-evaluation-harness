If no\n        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to\n        be one.\n\n        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value\n        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three\n        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the\n        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must\n        return a number or None to indicate a hidden edge.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    distance : iterator\n        (source, dictionary) iterator with dictionary keyed by target and\n        shortest path length as the key value.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)\n    >>> length = dict(nx.all_pairs_dijkstra_path_length(G))\n    >>> for node in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:\n    ...     print(f\"1 - {node}: {length[1][node]}\")\n    1 - 0: 1\n    1 - 1: 0\n    1 - 2: 1\n    1 - 3: 2\n    1 - 4: 3\n    >>> length[3][2]\n    1\n    >>> length[2][2]\n    0\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.\n    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.\n\n    The dictionary returned only has keys for reachable node pairs.\n    \"\"\"\n    length = single_source_dijkstra_path_length\n    for n in G:\n        yield (n, length(G, n, cutoff=cutoff, weight=weight))\n",
