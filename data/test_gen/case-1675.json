If this is an executable, it\n\n    might launch the executable in a new session.  The return value is\n\n    the exit code of the launched application.  Usually, ``0`` indicates\n\n    success.\n\n\n\n    Examples::\n\n\n\n        click.launch('https://click.palletsprojects.com/')\n\n        click.launch('/my/downloaded/file', locate=True)\n\n\n\n    .. versionadded:: 2.0\n\n\n\n    :param url: URL or filename of the thing to launch.\n\n    :param wait: Wait for the program to exit before returning. This\n\n        only works if the launched program blocks. In particular,\n\n        ``xdg-open`` on Linux does not block.\n\n    :param locate: if this is set to `True` then instead of launching the\n\n                   application associated with the URL it will attempt to\n\n                   launch a file manager with the file located.  This\n\n                   might have weird effects if the URL does not point to\n\n                   the filesystem.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    from ._termui_impl import open_url\n\n\n\n    return open_url(url, wait=wait, locate=locate)\n",
