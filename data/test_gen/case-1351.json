The logic should focus on semantic\n        information contained in the edge data or a formalized node class.\n\n        By acceptable, we mean that the subsequent mapping can still become a\n        complete isomorphism mapping.  Thus, if adding the candidate pair\n        definitely makes it so that the subsequent mapping cannot become a\n        complete isomorphism mapping, then this function must return False.\n\n        The default semantic feasibility function always returns True. The\n        effect is that semantics are not considered in the matching of G1\n        and G2.\n\n        The semantic checks might differ based on the what type of test is\n        being performed.  A keyword description of the test is stored in\n        self.test.

Implementations\n        should consider multigraphs.\n        \"\"\"\n        return True\n",
