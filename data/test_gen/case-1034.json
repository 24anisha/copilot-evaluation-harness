Less-happy moods may be reported if the connection\n        closed due to a ``WrongPasswordError`` or because of a timeout.\n\n        ``close()`` returns a Deferred, which fires after the server has been\n        informed and the sockets have been shut down.  One-shot applications\n        should delay shutdown until this Deferred has fired, to increase the\n        chances that server resources will be freed.  Long-running\n        applications can probably ignore the Deferred, as they'll probably\n        remain running long enough to allow the shutdown to complete.\n\n        The Deferred will errback if the wormhole had problems, like a\n        ``WrongPasswordError``.\n\n        :return: a Deferred that fires when shutdown is complete\n        :rtype: ``Deferred``\n        \"\"\"\n",
