There are tools which use\n    docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user\n    interactively browse through code; it\u2019s good practice to include docstrings in code that you\n    write, so make a habit of it.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the\n    # function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local\n    # symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the\n    # local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in\n    # the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly assigned a value\n    # within a function (unless named in a global statement), although they may be referenced.\n    fibonacci_list = []\n    previous_number, current_number = 0, 1\n    while previous_number < number_limit:\n        # The statement result.append(a) calls a method of the list object result. A method is a\n        # function that \u2018belongs\u2019 to an object and is named obj.methodname, where obj is some\n        # object (this may be an expression), and methodname is the name of a method that is\n        # defined by the object\u2019s type. Different types define different methods. Methods of\n        # different types may have the same name without causing ambiguity. (It is possible to\n        # define your own object types and methods, using classes, see Classes) The method\n        # append() shown in the example is defined for list objects; it adds a new element at\n        # the end of the list. In this example it is equivalent to result = result + [a], but\n        # more efficient.\n        fibonacci_list.append(previous_number)\n        # This is multiple assignment statement.
